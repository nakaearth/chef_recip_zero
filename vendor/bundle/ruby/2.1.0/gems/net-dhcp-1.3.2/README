Net::DHCP library for ruby, originally written by etd.
Fork to github by syonbori.
Additional fork and gemification by mjtko.

Here is original README:
The svn repository for Net::DHCP contains the project files to use with NetBeans IDE.

Use "rake" in the /lib folder to generate rdoc documentation.

Expect lots of changes in the near future both to the folder structure and the project architecture :)

Have fun,

etd
